# [IBM-Granite-3B-Code-Instruct: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of code understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/ibm_granite_3b_code_instruct)

Granite-3B-Code-Instruct-2K is a 3B parameter model fine tuned from Granite-3B-Code-Base-2K on a combination of permissively licensed instruction data to enhance instruction following capabilities including logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

This is based on the implementation of IBM-Granite-3B-Code-Instruct found [here](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3b-code-instruct-2k). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/ibm_granite_3b_code_instruct).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.
